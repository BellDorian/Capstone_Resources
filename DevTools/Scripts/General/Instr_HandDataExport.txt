1. Highlight the "Hand" column of the session object's data table.

2. Right click, and hover your mouse over "New Workspace Variable From Selection".

3. Select the option that says "New Cell Array", creating a new cell array with all of your hand data in it. 

4. Save your cell array file with a descriptive name. The naming convention I used was as such: HandData_Scene3_Side2

5. Open the handDataExpanderScript.m in MATLAB, and configure the indicated variable values according to the instructions from the comments.
        Note that you will certainly need to set the handDataCellArray variable equal to your descriptive cell array file name.

6. Run segment A. Copy and past the entire console ouput into the tab of your spreadsheet dedicate to Segment A hand data.

7. Repeat step 6 for segments B and C.
