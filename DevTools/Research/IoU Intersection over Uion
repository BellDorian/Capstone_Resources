Notes:
oct 22 => There is not a lot on IoU using Matlab compared to using python. I have searched both video's and webpages. I am continuing to work on finding out how
we can implement this in our project. My next step is to search the campus library to see what I can find from there. I understand the concept, the math
behind the code, but I am working on find out how to work with it using all the boxes he required us to use. Will discuss this more indepth once we are
meeting.
